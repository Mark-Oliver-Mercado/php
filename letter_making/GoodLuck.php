        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 1: Write Your Address</h2>
            <img src="address-example.jpg" alt="Your Address Example" />
            <p>Start by writing your address at the top right corner of the page, just like you would in a traditional letter. This lets the recipient know where the letter came from.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 2: Write the Date</h2>
            <img src="date-example.jpg" alt="Date Example" />
            <p>Write the date just below your address. For example, "November 20, 2024". Including the date will help the recipient know when the letter was sent.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 3: Greeting</h2>
            <img src="greeting-example.jpg" alt="Greeting Example" />
            <p>Start with a friendly greeting, such as "Dear [Recipient's Name]," or "Hello [Recipient's Name],". Make sure to use their name to personalize the letter.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 4 -->
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 4: Express Your Good Luck Wishes</h2>
            <img src="body-example.jpg" alt="Body of the Letter Example" />
            <p>In the body of the letter, express your good luck wishes. For example, "I just wanted to take a moment to wish you the best of luck as you prepare for your upcoming exam. I know you'll do great!"</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 5 -->
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 5: Offer Encouragement</h2>
            <img src="encouragement-example.jpg" alt="Encouragement Example" />
            <p>Offer words of encouragement that can help build the recipient's confidence. For example, "I believe in you and your abilities. You've worked hard, and I’m sure you will succeed!"</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 6 -->
        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 6: End on a Positive Note</h2>
            <img src="positive-note-example.jpg" alt="Positive Note Example" />
            <p>Finish the letter by reminding them that you’re cheering them on. "No matter what happens, know that I am proud of you and will be rooting for you every step of the way!"</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 7 -->

            <h2>Step 7: Closing Your Letter</h2>
            <img src="closing-example.jpg" alt="Closing Example" />
            <p>Close your letter with an uplifting and supportive phrase like "Best of luck," "Wishing you all the best," or "You’ve got this!" followed by your name. If you are sending a physical letter, don’t forget to sign it.</p>
